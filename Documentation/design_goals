The purpose of serio is to provide a way to transfer files to and from
a remote system over a serial device, with a minimal dependency on
programs on the remote system.

  - The type of targeted remote system is an embedded Linux computer.

  - The remote system is expected to have a shell attached to the serial port.

  - The remote system is expected to have at least some basic commands and
    programs, such as provided by busybox or toybox.

serio may implement methods of file transfer that utilize more extensive
capabilities on the remote system for reasons such as improved throughput
and increased data integrity.  Any such enhanced capability MAY NOT remove
the ability to instead use the algorithm(s) that have fewer remote system
dependencies.

The Fuego test framework project has chosen to use serio to support a
serial link as an alternate communication channel with a remote system
to be tested.  Serio has been enhanced in a few ways to support the needs
of Fuego to execute shell commands on a remote system and to extend the
complexity of the specification of files to be copied.  These two features
are modelled to be similar (but not identical) to the ssh and scp commands.
One of the design goals of serio is to support the needs of the Fuego test
framework in a way that does not interfere with the other serio design
goals.
